Students will be introduced to the current methodologies used to study aging as we explore the physical, cognitive, and psychosocial changes in individuals over the age of 60. The lectures, readings and assignments will address a range of topics that include expected versus abnormal changes in memory, creativity, the shifting roles of the elderly in family and society, and coping with illness and loss. In light of the fact that individuals over the age of 85 are the fastest-growing segment of the global population, and that the majority are women (approximately 2:1), we will also study changes associated with gender roles and sexuality during our later years.
