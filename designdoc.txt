* Database

**Tables





** Gen eds
Many-to-many relationship with courses. Some gen eds have extra text (eg 'NWNL when taken with...'); this extra information should be stored in the course as 'Notes'.
** Incorporating Spreadsheet with Detailed Info
Has section name, min credits, max credits, title, faculty first name, faculty last names, buidling, room, start time, end time, days, 7 weeks
** Database Management
Creating functions to reset courses, but not reviews.

** Searching
***Title keyword Search is case sensitive
PRIORITY: MED 
I added a quick capitalize method to whatever word they search. Couldn't test with heroku because I can't push, but it should work. This only works when the user searchs for one word. 
NOTE: Title keyword search may be removed in leiu of a general keyword search

***Maybe implement a general keyword search?


* Misc-a - 
** Page Icon
PRIORITY: MED
Now we just have the blank white square. It could be nice to have something like a interlocked N and C instead.
** Display maintainence
*** Mobile Display of results
PRIORITY: LOW
The new "..." feature on the results page is super slick, but when you go to a mobile device, you don't see much more than the course_id. Maybe a way to cut out course id and leave the title
*** Expanding "Cookie Cutter" Dispaly
PRIORIY: LOW   
Someone mentioned that the display was pretty basic, which isn't really a big deal, but eventually it may be something we want to improve. Maybe have a persistent search in the side panel.  
***Centering the form on the page. 

* New Features
** Schedule Planner
*** List of interested courses
Course pages should have a button to add to the list of courses they are interested in
*** Detect time conflicts and suggest schedules that work
*** Warn about prequisites
*** Suggest courses to fufill specific gen eds
** Accounts?


*Things to think about
**incorporating python and javascript
