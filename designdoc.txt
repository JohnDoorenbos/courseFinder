* Database (Model)
** "courses" Table
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
The online course catalog is in the NorseCourse database, in the "courses" table. This contains the official course description, department, course number, id, credits, if it is the same as another course, if it fulfils any gen eds, and if there are any prerequisites.

*** Source
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
All information for the "courses" table comes from the online course catalog, at "http://www.luther.edu/catalog". The catalog is parsed using Beautiful Soup and regular expressions, in "coursedata.py".

NOTE: The resulting data is returned as a list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing a course. For consistency across the application, specifically with the API, we should consider returning the data as a dictionary where the key is the course id and the value is a dictionary for that course.

*** Management
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: MEDIUM
There is currently no way to get updated information from the course catalog without reinitializing the entire database.

** "reviews" Table
STATUS: WIP
PRIORITY: HIGH
Reviews currently only contain a rating and text. Since we have decided to move away from reviews and towards simply alternate course descriptions, ratings should be removed. Furthermore, information about "up votes", "down votes", whether a review has been flagged as inappropriate, and the date/time the review was submitted should be added. Another consideration is whether a review has been approved, if we choose to only show display reviews after they have been approved. Yet another possibility is to include the IP address of the user who submitted the review, for the possibility of banning IP addresses which abuse the reviews.

*** Source
STATUS: WIP
PRIORITY: HIGH
Reviews are submitted by users online, but submitions are not monitored or in any way restricted. Submittion will also need to be updated to reflect the changes discussed above.

*** Relationships
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
Reviews have a many-to-one relationship with "courses".

*** Management
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: MEDIUM
There are currently no functions to manage reviews. There should be functions to display reviews which have been flagged, have too many downvotes, or have not been approved, and then the ability to set whether or not those reviews should be displayed.

** "gen eds" Table
STATUS: WIP
PRIORITY: HIGH
Currently gen ed fulfillments are a row in the the "courses" table, containing a string representing the list of gen eds a course fulfills. However, it would make sense for "gen eds" to be their own table, with many-to-many relationship with "courses". That would allow easy search for both all the gen eds a course fulfills and all the courses that fulfill a gen ed.

*** Source
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
Has the same source as "courses" above.

NOTE: Currently, the source returns gen eds as a string of gen eds separated by ", ". Another format might prove better for the new gen eds table.

*** Management
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: HIGH
"gen eds" should be updated along with "courses" whenever the latest catalog data is gathered.

* User Interface (View)

Once Schedule Planner is implemented, possibly add user accounts (perhaps using gmail) to let users continue sessions across devices.

* Misc Notes and Discussion

* ##### OLD DESIGN DOC #####

** Incorporating Spreadsheet with Detailed Info
Has section name, min credits, max credits, title, faculty first name, faculty last names, buidling, room, start time, end time, days, 7 weeks

** Searching
***Title keyword Search is case sensitive
PRIORITY: MED 
I added a quick capitalize method to whatever word they search. Couldn't test with heroku because I can't push, but it should work. This only works when the user searchs for one word. 
NOTE: Title keyword search may be removed in leiu of a general keyword search

***Maybe implement a general keyword search?


** Misc-a - 
*** Page Icon
PRIORITY: MED
Now we just have the blank white square. It could be nice to have something like a interlocked N and C instead.
*** Display maintainence
**** Mobile Display of results
PRIORITY: LOW
The new "..." feature on the results page is super slick, but when you go to a mobile device, you don't see much more than the course_id. Maybe a way to cut out course id and leave the title
**** Expanding "Cookie Cutter" Dispaly
PRIORIY: LOW   
Someone mentioned that the display was pretty basic, which isn't really a big deal, but eventually it may be something we want to improve. Maybe have a persistent search in the side panel.  
****Centering the form on the page. 

** New Features
*** Schedule Planner
**** List of interested courses
Course pages should have a button to add to the list of courses they are interested in
**** Detect time conflicts and suggest schedules that work
**** Warn about prequisites
**** Suggest courses to fufill specific gen eds
*** Accounts?


** Things to think about
***incorporating python and javascript
