* Database (Model)
** "courses" Table
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
The online course catalog is in the NorseCourse database, in the "courses" table. This contains the official course description, department, course number, id, credits, if it is the same as another course, if it fulfils any gen eds, and if there are any prerequisites.

*** Source
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
All information for the "courses" table comes from the online course catalog, at "http://www.luther.edu/catalog". The catalog is parsed using Beautiful Soup and regular expressions, in "coursedata.py".

NOTE: The resulting data is returned as a list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing a course. For consistency across the application, specifically with the API, we should consider returning the data as a dictionary where the key is the course id and the value is a dictionary for that course.

*** Management
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: MEDIUM
There is currently no way to get updated information from the course catalog without reinitializing the entire database.

** "alt_descs" Table
STATUS: WIP
PRIORITY: MEDIUM
Alternative descriptions contain text, the date submitted, and boolean value for approval. Furthermore, information about "up votes", "down votes", or helpfulness could be added. Yet another possibility is to include the IP address of the user who submitted the review, for the possibility of banning IP addresses which abuse the reviews.

*** Source
STATUS: WIP
PRIORITY: LOW
Reviews are submitted by users online, but submitions are not displayed until approved.

*** Relationships
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
Reviews have a many-to-one relationship with "courses".

NOTE: We might want to consider a many-to-many relationship with courses, given that some courses have entries with multiple departments.

*** Management
STATUS: WIP
PRIORITY: LOW
There are currently no functions to manage reviews. There should be functions to display reviews which have been flagged, have too many downvotes, or have not been approved, and then the ability to set whether or not those reviews should be displayed.

** "gen_eds" Table
STATUS: WIP
PRIORITY: HIGH
Currently gen ed fulfillments are a row in the the "courses" table, containing a string representing the list of gen eds a course fulfills. However, it would make sense for "gen eds" to be their own table, with many-to-many relationship with "courses". That would allow easy search for both all the gen eds a course fulfills and all the courses that fulfill a gen ed.

*** Source
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
Has the same source as "courses" above.

NOTE: Currently, the source returns gen eds as a string of gen eds separated by ", ". Another format might prove better for the new gen eds table.

*** Management
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: HIGH
"gen eds" should be updated along with "courses" whenever the latest catalog data is gathered.

* User Interface (View)
Note that anything marked as done might need to be updated as features are added and can always be tweaked.

** Course Catalog
*** Catalog Main Page
*** Department Pages
*** Course Pages

** Course Finder
*** Basic Search
STATUS: WIP
PRIORITY: HIGH
We have a page for basic search. We should integrate basic search into the sidebar so that new searching can be conveniently done from any page.
*** Advanced Search
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: HIGH

** Alternative Course Descriptions
Alternative descriptions are submitted on the course pages in the catalog.

** Schedule Planner
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: LOW
Schedule planner not yet implemented. No related UI.

** About
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A

** API Documentation
STATUS: WIP
PRIORITY: MED
The documentation is out of date. There is a warning at the top of the documentation page. We might want to wait until after the advanced search and related features are implemented to update the documentation.

* Main Features (Controller)
** Course Catalog
STATUS: WIP
PRIORITY: MED
Currently, the catalog includes information about regularly offered courses. We should expand it to get data for the spreadsheets about specific sections and semesters. We might also want to expand it to include information about programs for majors and minors.

** Course Finder
*** Basic Search
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
*** Advanced Search
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: HIGH
*** History
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
A history of recently visited courses is kept and is consistent across sessions. It keeps the last 10 course pages visits.

** Alternative Course Descriptions
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A

** Schedule Planner
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: LOW
Once we had information about specific sections in the catalog, we can work on detecting conflicts between sections, and possibly suggesting schedules given desired credits, courses, gen eds, etc.

** API
STATUS: DONE
PRIORITY: N/A
The API is finished, and any changes to search will automatically work for the API as well. Once Schedule Planner is implemented, we might need to change the API to work with that as well.

NOTE: The documentation is outdated.

** Accounts
STATUS: NOT STARTED
PRIORITY: LOW
Once Schedule Planner is implemented, possibly add user accounts (perhaps using gmail) to let users continue sessions across devices.
