Broken catalog links? 


#########Thoughts for new development:##########
Using current semester information. (This will start including professors)

Make links out of the different gen_eds and what not.

Reviews (upvotes downvotes)

functions for managing database (review management)

Major requirements in department pages

Having a little sort by drop down in the results page

Add more api functionality?
