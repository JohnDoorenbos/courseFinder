USE WTForms

Also use flask plugins for boot strap and stuff. Might have to putter around with that a bit. 





What are questions we have about the project?

Too big?

Where can we get our information from? 
Professors - Is there a database of professors (maybe with bios)that we can grab?
Classes - Every Semester, this changes, so we can't hardcode a class schedule in.
   What would be great is if there is something that has all of next semesters classes, times and professors that we could get access to. 

Getting information:
  writte pyhton scrtip using URLLIB  (beautiful soup [grab from registrars web page] some guy Doug)
