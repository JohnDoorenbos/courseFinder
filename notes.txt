<------------------Things for John to look at:------------------->

Searching through the sql alchemy tables for reviews, in particular for creating a unique identifier for new reviews being added (think integers)

Create a basic catalog. eventually make it more navigatable. 

continue developing the results page display.

Make a display for History (something to be inherited from base.html. i.e Needs to be on every page)

Get this deployed as a heroku app!


<---------------------------------------------------------------->   

#########Thoughts for new development:##########


Make links out of the different gen_eds and what not.

Also use flask plugins for boot strap and stuff. Might have to putter around with that a bit.
