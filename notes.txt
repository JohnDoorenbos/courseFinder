Displaying Reviews

Deploying on Heroku (I'll ask today)

What's it look like on a phone? (And Styling)

Catalog


Sorting results consistently
<------------------Things for John to look at:------------------->

Searching through the sql alchemy tables for reviews, in particular for creating a unique identifier for new reviews being added (think integers)

Create a basic catalog. eventually make it more navigatable. 

continue developing the results page display.


Get this deployed as a heroku app!

#########Thoughts for new development:##########


Make links out of the different gen_eds and what not.
