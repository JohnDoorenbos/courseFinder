<h1>About</h1>

<div class="course">
  <h2>Norse Course</h2>
  <p> A website designed by students for students. It offers various functionalities, including a user friendly catalog, a catalog search, and course reviews.

  <h2>Search</h2>
  <p>The catalog search tool allow students to search for courses according to department, title keyword, and most importantly, general education fulfillment. This allows the student to find the courses they need to take easily and quickly, while at the same time showing them classes they never would have known existed! For example, who would have known you could satisfy your Natural World Non-Lab requirement with <a href="/catalog/CLAS/CLAS310">CLAS 310: Ancient Sciences</a>? This functionality will open a whole new world of classes to students. </p>
    
  <h2>Catalog</h2>
  <p> The catalog offers a user friendly interface for students to navigate the all of the classes offered on a regular basis by Luther College. Separated by department, students can easily view each course offered by a certain department.</p>

  <h2>User-submitted Descriptions</h2>
  <p>Norse Course provides a unique functionality in that it lets students submit alternative descriptions for courses they have already taken. Sometimes the official descriptions are somewhat lacking, or even misleading. Students can offer advice to each other about what the course is <em>really</em> like. The descriptions will be monitored and removed if deemed inappropriate or offensive.</p>

  <h2>API</h2>
  <p>If you are interested in using some of the functionality we have implemented here for your own web applications, you can find details on how to use our custom built API <a href="/api/docs"> here</a>.</p>

  <h2>More information</h2>
  <p> This Norse Course website was developed by Michael Moore ('16) and John Doorenbos ('16), both computer science majors, as a final project for a Internet Programming class.
